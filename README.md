# aws-web-app-ipv4-to-binary
- This is a simple web app that converts an IPv4 address into its binary equivalent.
- I used/adapted the following resources for the development of this app:
  - AWS Getting Started Resource Center at https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-web-app-s3-lambda-api-gateway-dynamodb/
  - Tiny Technical Tutorials: Architect and Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application from Scratch | AWS Tutorial for Beginners at https://youtu.be/7m_q1ldzw0U 


## Below is an example of the web app in action:
